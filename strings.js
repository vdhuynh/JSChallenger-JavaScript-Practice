const text = 'hello world';
console.log('The value of text is: ' + text);

const textOne = 'Hello, ';
const textTwo = "it's ";
const textThree = `me`;
console.log(textOne, textTwo, textThree);

The author's solution
const textOne = 'Hello';
const textTwo = 'World';
const combined = textOne + ' ' + textTwo;
console.log(combined);

const word = 'interesting';
const sentence = `She had an ${word} idea.`;
console.log(sentence);

const sentence = `The ice cream costs ${1+1} dollars`;
